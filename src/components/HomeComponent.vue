      Resort is equipped with full RV hook ups as well as spots for tent camping. We also

      Vacationers will find our boat launching ramp is easily accessible, allowing for more 
      time to play and relax in the water. Plan on bringing your rafts, floats, coolers, and 
      chairs to our day use area where you can spend a day soaking in the sun and relaxing to 
      your fullest extent. After a long day of fun in the sun you can enjoy sitting around a 
      camp-fire gazing at the millions of stars in our beautiful and clear California skies.

      We have great weather all year long. Our summers are sunny and hot, and the winter daily 
      temperatures are on average of 70 Â°F. Flocks of snow-birds soar in year after year during 
      the winter to meet up with their friends from across the country at our resort.
